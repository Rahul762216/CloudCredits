⚙️ How It Works
🧩 Blog Data Array
(Optional) Blog content can be stored in a JavaScript array of objects (title, date, image, summary).

📲 Render Posts
JavaScript dynamically injects blog cards into the DOM.

🌙 Dark Mode
A toggle button adds/removes a .dark-mode class on the body.

📊 Responsive Design
Media queries ensure the blog looks great on mobile and desktop screens.
