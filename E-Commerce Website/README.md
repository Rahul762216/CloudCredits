⚙️ How It Works
🧩 Product Array
All product information can be stored in a JavaScript array of objects (image, name, price, category).

🖼️ Render Products
Products are dynamically inserted into the DOM using JavaScript.

🌗 Theme Toggle
JavaScript toggles a .dark-mode class on the body to switch themes.

🛍️ UI Interactions
On hover animations, fake cart buttons, and filters provide dynamic user experience.

📊 Responsiveness
Media queries in CSS ensure compatibility across all screen sizes.
